Implementation Details
----------------------

1. Open a csv file and read a line
2. Parse the line into data fields
3. Convert and format fields into appropriate data types
4. Build the following containers using our sample row:
	- single row flatbuffer
	- multirow flatbuffer
	- single row flexbuffer (map-based)
	- single row flexbuffer (vector-based)
	- multirow flatbuffer of flexbuffer (vector-based) rows
5. Use gettimeofday() to start timing data access

loop for n = 100,000 runs
6. Access one of the following:
	- entire row of data
	- individual fields within row
endloop

7. Stop timing
8. Average the time by dividing by n (number of runs)
